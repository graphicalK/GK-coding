# GK-coding

Welcome to the GitHub for Graphical Kitties! 
I put my coding projects and other things that I made over the past 3 years

I code mainly in Python or C, but may expand to other languages like C# or Java.
If you wish to run any of the programs, download VSCode by Microsoft and install the plugins for the language, then insert the code.
